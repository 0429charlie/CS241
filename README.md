Assignemnts for CS241 - Foundations of Sequential Programs

This repository includes all the assignment from CS241 - Fundations of Sequential Programs that create a simple C-like compiler at the end. Please refer to Outline.pdf for the course outline and cs241.pdf for the purpose of each assignment (1~10). While the original files that explains each assignment is lost, the following are some vague description for each:

A1: Manual translation between machine language (in hex) and assembly language

A2: Programmed MIPS programs using assembly language

A3~A4: Program that perform intepretation of Regular expressions, Scanning and searching.

A5~A7: Program that perform Top-down (LL(1)) and bottom-up parsing (LR(1)).

A8~A10: Code generation for WLPP grammar rule using assembler, loader, relocation, and linkers given or generated in past assignments (WLPP is the c-like programming language developed in the University of Waterloo for educational purpose).

Please follow cs241.pdf for the step and the main concept thought in class. For assignemnt 10, wlp4gen.cc is the compiler and wlp4i is the input and asm is the outputed assemply language.
